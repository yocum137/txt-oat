A Red Hat &amp; Intel Joint Project: scripts to ease TXT/OAT deployment for OpenStack.
txt-oat git repo is for a Joint Red Hat and Intel project to showcase OpenStack
and TXT (Trusted eXecution Technology).

These scripts are meant to be a stop-gap solution while the final Intel
software is developed to ease enabling of tboot, trusted boot, and registering
a tboot enabled node with the OAT, Open Attestation, Service.
